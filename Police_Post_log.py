        Police check posts require a centralized system for logging, tracking, and analyzing vehicle movements. 
        Currently, manual logging and inefficient databases slow down security processes. 
        This project aims to build an SQL-based check post database with a Python-powered dashboard for real-time insights and alerts
    
        **Features:**
        - Display vehicle logs, violations, and officer reports.
        - Implement SQL-based search filters for quick lookups.
        - Generate analytics and trends (e.g., high-risk vehicles)
